# SQL Database settings
#
# For most servers, the default options here are perfect. Most users will not need to bother here.
#
# However, for servers wishing to use MariaDB / MySQL, or for large servers wishing to tweak performance,
# further setup is required.
#
#
# Note well:
# To apply changes made here, use '/libertybans RESTART' or restart the server.
# Using '/libertybans RELOAD' will NOT update your database settings!
# 
#

# What RDMS vendor category will you be using?
# Available options:
# - 'HSQLDB' - Local HyperSQL database. No additional setup required.
# - 'MARIADB' - Requires a separate MariaDB or MySQL database.
rdms-vendor: 'HSQLDB'
#
# How large should the connection pool be?
# A thread pool of similar size is derived from the connection pool size.
# For most servers, the default option is suitable.
connection-pool-size: 6
#
# Connection timeout settings
# LibertyBans uses HikariCP for connection pooling. The following settings control connection timeouts.
timeouts:
  # How long, at maximum, should LibertyBans wait when acquiring new connections, if no existing connection is available?
  connection-timeout-seconds: 20
  # How long, at maxium, should a connection in the pool last before having to be recreated?
  # This value should be set for MariaDB or MySQL. HikariCP warns you:
  # "It should be several seconds shorter than any database or infrastructure imposed connection time limit"
  max-lifetime-minutes: 25
# MariaDB / MySQL authentication details
# These must be changed to the proper credentials in order to use MariaDB/MySQL
auth-details:
  host: localhost
  port: 3306
  database: bans
  user: username
  password: defaultpass
# Connection properties to be applied to database connections
# These are specified in key-value format.

# Legacy option. Don't touch this unless you understand it or you're told to enable it.
use-traditional-jdbc-url: false
# Never touch the config version. This value is trusted; bad things can happen if you tamper with it.
