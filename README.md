ArimBans is the ultimate punitive solution for single servers and networks, seeking to maximise efficiency through near-total asynchronous operation.


**Notice**

This program is still in development. It is not yet production-ready.

Huge thanks to DevLeoko for inspiration to make ArimBans in the first place.
Also thanks the countless members on the Spigot community forums whose answers were the constant subject of my google searches.
