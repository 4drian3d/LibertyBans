# ArimBans
ArimBans is the ultimate punitive solution for single servers and networks, seeking to maximise efficiency through near-total asynchronous operation.

**Notice**
This program is still in development. It is not yet production-ready.

Huge thanks to DevLeoko for inspiration to make ArimBans in the first place.
