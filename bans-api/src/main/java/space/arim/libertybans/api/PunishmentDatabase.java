/**
 * Access to the raw database. <b>Use of this should be avoided at great cost. Executing SQL queries
 * is not considered traditional API.</b> <br>
 * <br>
 * The majority of users should never touch this directly. Instead, {@link PunishmentSelector} provides
 * predicate, error-free specifications using stable API. {@code PunishmentSelector} may be used to retrieve
 * punishments with all sorts of details from the database. <br>
 * <br>
 * <a>API Status</b> <br>
 * Use of the SQL backend directly is not considered traditional API. Although attempts will be made to limit
 * the number of breaking changes, LibertyBans's major version will not necessarily change to match the SQL backend.
 * Unlike other plugins, LibertyBans makes use of a wide swath of queries. <br>
 * <br>
 * Rather, a separate version is maintained specifically for the SQL backend. This version is maintained returned by
 * {@link #getMajorRevision()} and {@link #getMinorRevision()}. Additionally, it is located in the table
 * <code>libertybans_revision</code>, with the {@code major} and {@code minor} columns indicating the major version
 * and minor version, respectively (both columns use the INT data type). <br>
 * <br>
 * Whenever the tables and/or views definitions change incompatibly, the major version will be incremented. The minor
 * version will be incremented as new tables and views are added, but which do not break backwards compatibility.
 * <b>Use of any SQL functions or procedures created by LibertyBans is strictly unsupported and their presence might
 * as well be considered coincidental</b>
